    "As the company prepares for its next phase of growth, leadership wants to focus not just on adding new stores, but on increasing Total Sales Revenue from its existing network. This means a better understanding what drives revenue, from which products perform well, to how different regions, customer segments, and sales staff contribute to the bottom line.\n",

    "- Explore how different product categories, classifications, and features contribute to revenue across time.\n",
    "- Segment customers based on order value, quantity purchased, and spending behavior.\n",
    "- Evaluate the performance of individual sales employees and understand how their contribution varies by region or time.\n",
    "- Compare city-wise and country-wise sales patterns to highlight high- and low-performing areas.\n",
    "- Analyse trends over time to understand when sales peak or drop, and how this differs by product or location."
